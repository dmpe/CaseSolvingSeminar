Well, this poem MIGHT, loosely, imitate *PROPNAME*'s poem... Not sure I used enough imagery bought ""Season 1"" of the old Thundercats cartoon; watching the shit out of this old nostalgic favorite right now. On an unrelated note, I have TONS of homework. Looks like a good combination. What an ordeal this has been. This dog is killing me. So hard to keep he and Sparky separated too... Just slept from 7AM to 5PM @_@. Woops New (temporary) dog in my house. Concerned about worms, for his sake and Sparky's. I can really see this Dislike button being abused for very ironic purposes...

I feel pretty smart right now nonetheless. The French have redeemed themselves as a nationality with the invention of Parkour! Why so early? It was expected, but no school already?!

His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder* finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat. just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton. Who dat?! 1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad Who's gonna see the Harry Potter movie with me? The person who comes is still allowed to judge me. Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =) Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU. Brokeback is officially the most depressing movie of all time.

And now I like The Holiday?! forgot how much she missed House until she saw the premiere. Love it. Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it... Weekends go by so quickly... =( Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends!

Nothing like tea and Galetti to transport me back to early morning breakfasts in Florence. couldn't hate these new Gap commercials more. They are seriously the devil's handiwork. Sick day today =( never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due. The roof garden is born!

I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face.

I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point. Just burned out. *PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're ""way stronger than you think"" at doing bicep curls. And that's what I'm paying him for. 34,865 Kleenex and some codeine later, Kea rejoins the world of the living... *PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN.

I just....I can't do this without family...friends. Anybody ? (Breast cancer awareness question - what colour bra are you wearing ?) No colour. I'm not a fan of bras lately. But this is a stupid FB idea. It doesn't really raise awareness unless you also say what the hell it's about !  Stupid, stupid. Got the new iPhone 3GS. Don't ask how, I won't tell you. But thank you. Okay, sleep. Dreaming of bacon and dark chocolate. mmmm.... I have to find the superhero I use to be. I can't bring myself to believe it was just the Love of a silly boy that did it. It's moments like this that I wish I worked for Walmart. I hate rape. I'm no good at counseling ""victims"". Especially when it's a parental perpetrator. Why is this the way of the world ? Why is it reality ? I find I'm enjoying tiny poetry.  Such as: Rain- My ears hear a drip, drop, splash It's more of a scream, laugh, live And you make it so hard not to be cliche. You pile on my dreams,  Like power lines on a sky. Is it raining where you are ? My mind is so confusing, it's scary. I don't know where my mind is in this moment. It's so fleeting; emotion. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. And like *PROPNAME* says, a shotgun just leaves a messed up wall.  Ah well. Random thoughts. Better go to bed before that crap goes deeper. I always want the blog to be the magical valve. Turn it on, write, be healed. It never is though. And now I still hurt, I just feel more raw now. As long as I stay with the emotion and don't deny...I'll be alright. QTD: ""'Flower' usually refers to a vulva in general, not virginity or 'cherry popping' as the kids would say."" Hahahaha I feel emptied out; please rain down on me...darkness and light, come fill me up. My most awesome friend just surprise-attacked me with a present of a dark chocolate bacon bar...drool. Best. Moment. Ever. Off to a training, not back til Sunday. So tired. So in pain. Starbucks will make it all better, I know it ! ""Walking by the river I...reach my hands to cup the sky. It runs down my arms...a bitter blue. Turn to red, and the gashes grew."" God, this song...every word is raw and honest. Okay. Maybe not sleep. Again, my company and night are ruined by some physical ailment of mine. I am fucking tired of it. <3 I need to be asleep. I get up in....5 hrs ? No idea really. What am I doing again ? Okay, so what are the different plans for Friday night in LA ? There's *PROPNAME*...? Okay, must sleep. Must work in mere hours...ah who am I kidding ? I don't sleep. Or eat. Just smoke...and work. And love. My most Awesome Surgeon says I can try walking today and if all goes well, I can work tomorrow !! YAY !! I'm gonna need the money if I wanna try and quit this job to focus on my other jobs//opportunities. Wish me luck on the walking ! I'll report back. Fucking musicians. Fuck musicians... ""I like my chicken fried, a cold beer on a friday night, a pair of jeans that fit just right, and the radio up !"" Today was a much needed day off !! Back to a fake smile tomorrow, but rejuvinated by friends tonight. Well anyway, fuck it. I'm gonna die young but happy. Rather than healthy and old. ""I've been high, and I've been down, my head in the clouds and my hands on the ground. "" Now that I'm done writing, I need food...hmmm....

Aggrevated that I let someone else take me from really happy to hurt and depressed. It's on me to change my reaction to be one of Loveful Me. Sore throat starting out. Tempted to gargle vodka, but must get some work done. Wow been a tiring and painful day. Gonna set up a movie and try to relax. Love to all of my beautiful friends and family for the support and awesomeness of who they are. And a high five to my Surgeon who is THE man and gives me hope of having a less painful life. <3 you all. You make me happy, yes YOU. Okay, I'm no good at positivity right now. That's my work ""hat"". So sue me. Getting together map, snacks, music, and up-all-night accessories for Hollywood. Will starting driving at 4 am. It's ugly here. But there are sparks...moments. Love. Doctors seem to want me to sit out. In a wheelchair...no fucking way. I'd rather walk down the street with tears streaming, than be benched....which, unfortunately, is not too far off. Got called in to work tomorrow. At least I don't have to run groups. Bed early tonight. Gah, head's pounding. I wish I wasn't in so much pain. It makes the pills that much more tempting... Wow, fresh air. Crazy. Good day sunshine, you're my favourite star. ""I believe in love. It's just my heart that keeps turning me down. I believe in love, I think it's just fine."" Gonna be 83 degree today ! Coffee, sunshine, and sweet email from a friend. Day started with love, is continuing, and will end in love."

I think the top 5 NCAA teams could easily beat either of these teams. Sex can screw things up.  Why do you think the Three Stooges went through so many *PROPNAME*'s? just received an extra 360 kb of storage for his computer in the form of a 5 1//4"" floppy from the guy near me who's retiring.  It's going to come in handy for that extra 20 seconds of music that won't fit on my hard drive. is watching the USA play Switzerland in hockey and thinks the announcers should say that the Swiss team is full of holes. just found out that *PROPNAME* wrote both the Band-Aid song and the State Farm song.  *PROPNAME*.  For real.  I couldn't believe it either. has the same feelings about Up in the Air as Homer did about the three little pigs animatronics at Storytime Village.  ""That was good... but not great."" is not happy that *PROPNAME* pulled a Blaise.  I'll still go to your restaurant *PROPNAME*! is glad that apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop is slightly disappointed to find out that you harvest horsehair from the horses on Farmville rather than, say, glue or dog food.

Upon what basis do we judge other people? Is it ithe experiances that we ourselves have, or the belifes in which we hold? What sad news for the Gator nation today, the resignation of Urban Meyer. Our prayers will be with Coach Meyer and his family. Do you remember that song ""Break Stuff"" by Limp Bizkit? Thats kind of the day I'm having. is unemployed, and thinks its a good thing :) I love Mondays.... can every one grasp the sarcasm in that statement. I hope so.

ELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Press 1 for English. Press 2 to disconnect until you learn to speak English.

If you agree... copy and paste in your status DANG IT!!  If you are in Atlanta and need somehere to go for NYE, come to my house, I have food and drink, almost all of my guests are sick or have sick kids! I am hoping this is allergies and not a cold.. So apperently the owners at my school have decided that they want to make things as complicated as possible...enter new and stupidly expensive computer program! What do *PROPNAME* and the Miami Dolphins have in common? They make 70,000 people stand up and yell ""Jesus Christ""... black I am not ready to get back to real life...

Baking pumpkin bread and pumkin pies and making stuffing!! The guy next to me getting a mani//pedi tonight reminded me of someone my dad would golf with...kinda reminded me of home until he started singing along with the radio to Ace of Base, Madonna, and Cher.  It was so hard not to laugh!! So Atlanta! Well, I think he has the flu, but it is basically impossible to tell if he has the swine flu taking a much needed mental health day!

Day looking up, I will be able to exchange the defective flat iron!  I realized that New Moon comes out when I will be home for Thanksgiving, any body want to go see it with me?  Still looking forward to Glee...I feel a little dirty thinking that *PROPNAME* is hot So the guito from Jersey Shore that calls him self ""The Situtation"" is trying to trademerk it now... So Variety is reporting that the cast of Jersey Shore is coming back for a second season, making $10,000 per episode.  I guess they were making a few hundred per episode before.  That is alot of tanning, hair products, and tiny tops! Does this have to happen tonight...I have my fight club The ""Full House"" home is on the market for 4 mil.  I wonder if being fetured in the show increased its value :( Happy St Valentines Day! Going to have my emmissions tested, want to just get that out of the way and today seems like a good day for it!

It was good to get out of the house for a little while, and even better to see my girls! This rain has gotten me down today, that and the fact that my flat iron died...bad hair and I am cranky...At least I can look forward to Glee tonight! So much to do before tomorrow...I am actually a little overwhelmed! Lets go STATE!!  8-0 BABY! wow, nothing like losing to a MAC team to make me cry...I would like to thank pete for ruining the game for me as well...jurk... Dear Baby Jesus: Please compell my boyfriend to get off his ass and pack...we are leaving tomorrow at 5 am to go home and celibrate your birth...and i really dont want to have to kill him because then I will have to drive the Mustang in the snow and rosie is in mint condition and the salt will discolor my top.  Thanks so much... Keep your fingers crossed that *PROPNAME* kept his germs to himself... feeling much better today!  So if the head coach of Texas Tech was fired, is this even going to be a fair game?  Maybe considering many of our players were stupid... Hopefully this week will not kick my butt...I don't think I can take it again So now what am I suppost to do on Wensday nights?  Damn it Fox...no Glee until April?"

Thanks for all the birthday wishes yesterday! I had a great day:) is off to bed and hoping not to be woken up by things flapping and crashing from the crazy wind outside. On the up side it's going to be in the 60-70 range for the next week!:) went to see ""The Hangover"" tonight then came home to enjoy a nice relaxing jacuzzi tub bath with a glass of wine...life doesn't get much better than that! thinks it might be time for a nap:) Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house. just finished watching ""The Ugly Truth"", cute movie:) can't believe it. I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays! is making some grub perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :) really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me. didn't think that coming to take care of the water heater first thing in the morning meant 11...I guess there's still 45 mins until it afternoon! had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:) why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved. is a huge nerd and posting books on paperback swap:)"

""Is it special when you're lonely// do you spend your whole life// in a studio apartment// with a cat for a wife// The seasons, when they call you// do you barricade the door// are you stubborn, stubborn, stubborn to the core?...Then the longest winter// is on her way// you called her without knowing it// but now it's too late..."" Trying to keep the zen, but it's hard to hang onto sometimes on nights like these. is ok now. just remembered a TV ad from her childhood in the 'glorious' south: horribly fat, hideous ANGELS with big ol' hair, Tammy-Faye-esque makeup, and (of course) heavy southern accents hollering ""DON'T YOU BUY NO UUG-LY TRUUCK!"" Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA! Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much. I mean to go to bed early (to get over the Plague of Atlanta), and yet I end up staying up all night doing practically nothing.  Story of my life.  Hmph! Unproductive day...home sick & made no money, and no progress carwise...but at least I got some rest, I guess. *sigh* Supposedly Hauppauge means ""land of sweet water.""  Somehow I doubt the water's very ""sweet"" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district... 2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...) is trying not to be grumpy. About to go to bed so I can get up early to check out a car tomorrow morn...*crosses fingers* hope this one pans out; the longer I'm trapped, vehicleless, the more likely I am to go completely bloody mad! Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again! Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. :// Whew. ...my heart hurts. Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination. is amused at the universe today. *cracks up* Bev quote of the hour: ""Bah, the chaos gods can suck my intangible throbbing member."" Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but ""I'M NOT DEAD YET!!"" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed* Cold weather can bite me, and so can Christmas.  *sticks out tongue*  I'm doin' reasonably alright today but ehhhhh...got a 'eadache from 'ell. Well...if my interactions and happenings of last night were any indication, 2010 may well be a pretty good year...but we'll see!  Happy new year, love y'all! :D might have contracted the rockin' pneumonia...but I hope I don't get the boogie-woogie flu--it sounds repulsive!  By the way, I hate that song. (No, I'm not sick...I'm just a weirdo!) Meh. Bleh. Feh!! Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?! My car no longer screeches like a banshee passing kidney stones...thanks, Mr. Mechanic!  In other news, my 'simple' cold is worsening by the hour and I'm feverish...and all of the home remedies and cold meds I try are for naught!  Bah! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe! gonna stay late at work to get some extra stuff done, & then go home & veg out. I'm a geezer today, I guess... ""*PROPNAME* could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle the sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back...The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a kryptonite condom...but that would kill him!"" OI!!! ""Just another manic Monday""...nah, not really--if I was manic right now I'd probably be getting alot more done, lol! ...and now back to my regularly scheduled severe dangerously-nihilistic depression. :D!!!1!1!!!1!!!!one! Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile* Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly! is sick of the pain. God damn it...I need for my laptop to NOT freeze for 10 minutes before deciding to perhaps or perhaps not perform the command I've clicked...I need a car that isn't a fucking pretzel, or at least SOME form of viable transportation...I need ADD meds that don't leave me staring off into fucking space at work...GAHHH!  Very fucking frustrated!  Anyone with input re laptop or car, please comment...*sigh* Checking out a car in the morning...hope it checks out--I'm not enjoying this carless whatnottery! Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!! It just occurred to me that two of my favorite songs are punk songs about gruesome abortions (""Bodies"" by Sex Pistols and ""Die of Shame"" by Tilt)...man, I'm just not quite right, lol! Today's stream of consciousness: Hooray for comic books, poetry and nerds in general...forgot my phone at home today, blargh (couldn't reach me, that's why)...swamped at work...pretzels suck...missing NOLA (especially the Quarter) alot today for some reason...""the holidays"" are annoying me already...Wikipedia is addictive...so is Facebook, gods help me...! Heh...:""God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong! I hate people!//I hate the human race//I hate people!//I hate your ugly face//I hate people!//I hate your fucking mess//I hate people!//They hate me!""-Anti-Nowhere League Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D Meh.  Humans are a fickle species. Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles* *Rootin' around for 'retro' Bev pics* ""Yes yes yes, effervescently meaningless..."" I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah! Hangin' with *PROPNAME*...stay awake, stay awake! *pokes self with fork* Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under ""O"" for ""Owwww""* ""Some of the shows on MTV are not my cup of tea...mainly because I don't like huge pieces of shit in my tea!"" What's black and green and red all over?  Me after the GWAR show, YEAH! XD  Time for the sleep of a lifetime now, though...damn. Had bad dreams last night, some sobering thoughts on my mind...yet I'm still in a good mood today.  I don't get it, but I'm not complaining! will probably be taking a hiatus from facebook again for a bit...you know where to reach me if you wish to do so! Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.) ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche feels kinda better after going home early yesterday & resting...24-hour bug?  Whatever it was I'ma try to take it easy today too. Feeling DAMN GOOD headwise lately: forceful self-change of outlook, meds seem to be finally working, & I'm startin to get shit done! 'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy! Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears. Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol... *sigh* has been too busy living life to spend much time on facebook this week--just the way I like it! :D Am engaged in battle with the Plague-beasts of Atlanta. *sneeze*  Vitamins make good ammo in such altercations! Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh... is relaxing... I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like! Sorry I had to bail so early on Sanctuary last night, folks...sick & tired does not a fun Bev make--sittin' in the corner like ol' granny watchin' the kiddies play outside! *scrunches nose* It's a DK kind of day. *nod* Bah! Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind. I lahk the cut o' yerr jib...*licks teeth creepily* I gotta ask: why pirates OR ninjas?  Why not both?  Also, two interesting concepts I've recently discovered: Horror Cakes competition on Food Network tomorrow (one of them bleeds when you cut the cake! AWESOME!)...and a children's book series I saw in the bookstore recently, called Vampirates...I dig the name, and the concept...not sure about the execution though.  Still...intriguing! has a tummyache (again, stupid tummy) but is otherwise alright! It's insane how much time one has to spend on the telephone with basically everyone in Christendom after a big car accident...blahhhh...deliver me from being on hold all day! *glares at phone* Me da is my hero right now...he found me some fucking NYQUIL!!  25 hours awake is waaaay more than enough (especially when I'm sick).  Going to go smoke with the ghost in the back of my head (heyy, random little-remembered song reference!).  GOODNIGHT FOLKS!! I know it's gonna be a 'pajama weekend' when I find myself doing my weekend grocery shopping at the 7-11 at 5:30 a.m... Almost forgot it was Sunday night...yay for new Venture Bros. eps!  (My preciousssss...)  But DUDE, who saw the Metalocalypse season premiere?  When that ""surprise thing"" happened I literally screamed in joy (woke up my dad, lol)!  Maybe semi-expected but still, WOOT! Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me ""Was machts du gerade"" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :P I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated. BRRR!  ""Stiff Little Fingers"" indeed! ""I said he's a fairy I do suppose//flyin thru the air in pantyhose//he may be very sexy or even cute//but he looks like a sucka in a blue and red suit//I said you need a man who's got finesse//& his whole name across his chest//he may be able to fly all thru the night//but can he rock a party til the early light//he can't satisfy you with his little worm//but I can bust you out w my Super sperm!!"" Rapper's Delight on Superman doesn't know what to think. ""Woo-hah! Woo-hah! Got you all in check!"" LOL ""And life is thorny, and youth is vain; And to be wroth with ones we love doth work like madness in the brain.""--Samuel Taylor Coleridge Ok...broken snow shovel, and the plow bastard we called is 2 hours late.  Don't mind too much that I'm missing work, but I DO mind that I have no food in the house and wanted to go BUY SOME FUCKING FOOD!  That plow motherfucker will be getting my SPACEBOOT up his PLOWTASTIC ASS!  As long as I don't pass out from starvation first, hmph. ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again. Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment! Went and got the last of my stuff out of my...car...(read: twisted metal heap with fuzzy seats) this morning.  It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though... So very frustrated...& kinda sad. And so fucking sleepy...god DAMN these meds, I'm sleeping my life away. Why do I insist on eating popsicles in winter?  OM NOM NOM Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face* is very well-rested, lol. Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!! Spacemen 3 are pretty good...but in moderation--too many songs in a row and they'll put you to sleep! Zzzzz... It's amazing what you'll watch on TV when you stay up all night. is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment! Never enough Dammit dammit I can't SLEEP!  Awake all night then tried to fall asleep for 4 hours.  At least if I had hypothermia I'd fall unconscious...hmm.  But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise! My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb. Feeling pretty good since the whole 'tweaking my outlook' kick I've been on...except for this sore throat//sniffles thing, geh. But I'll live...hey, drinking tea goes along with the zen thing anyway, lol. Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya... Ehh...bite me! Hoping this insane wind doesn't blow me away to Oz...those Munchkins might've gone feral by now. *shudder* Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise! Is still pretty much on facebook hiatus...if you message me I'll probably answer though. Otherwise, most of you know where to find me! Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.  Getting the fuck outta LI, seeing my superawesome folks, finally getting some proper southern food, and maybe even checking out Decatur nightlife & Williams Street...the word of the day is ""YAAAYYYYY!"" Faring alright, I s'pose...just sore, and scouring the universe for used Toyotas & Hondas...  Need transportation, STAT!  Anyone with input on the car front, please comment!  Hope everyone's Halloween rocked... Happy thingy, people... ""Coming to work is like being raped by a paper factory.""--me (to my dadboss) on working at a law office. Today's sky is as grey as my default mood setting.  Sometimes it's rather exhausting being so exquisitely angst-ridden...*rolls eyes, sighs* Doing enough work to compensate for being in Atlanta Thursday & Friday...blehhhh.  (Still at work at frickin' midnight!)  But the trip, the company & the brief respite from LI will be soooo bloody appreciated. Have good weekend, meine leibschen, yes yes!  I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!) Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me! ""Got an animated corpse//at my beck & call//you will find my skin cells underneath his fingernails//Carpet fibers from my car//Covering his coat and clinging to his follicles//Everyday we meet//Plot fourteen//As he hops in the front in the seat next to me//He can't wait til I tell him what I need//Then he nods a rotting head and then I set him free"" Feelin' pretty lousy today...basically zombie-ing through work, and not in the fun way.  I feel like part of my brain is missing and has been replaced by canned air.  Bleah...Monday is definitely my least favorite day! is checking her facebook a little more than she used to...but facebook still bombards her with more information than she has time to fool with!  Taking things at a glance. Gah...sick of feeling like crap! Gods deliver me from resilient falltime ailments...*brandishes stick menacingly...then gets dizzy and passes out* I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off! Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick* I will be fine.  I've gotten through everything that has ever been thrown at me--nothing can keep me down for long. This morning my dad said ""it smells weird in your apartment.""  Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh... Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored! 2 people today mentioned that my Wall is disabled from being posted on...I didn't even know! Lol, changed it...post at will I guess. *shrug!* In other news...YAY CARTOONS! ""YEEES, we have no// bananas// todaaaaayyy!"" Ok lady I love you buh-bye! *finally leaves house* Yay Mythbusters!  Ninjas, explosions, and science, oh my! :D *nerdnerdnerd*"

Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heaven is playing the FTOPS main event in his hotel in Nice... trying to stay patient tho i'm tired from a day of travelling and just want to sleep.  Tomorrow I go for a week on a yacht... more R&R + fun people + a whole lotta gambling... sounds like a slice of heaven. is playing the main event today, day 1B finished Fooled by Randomness... it's an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone.  I'm now 80 pages into Chaos by *PROPNAME* and am enjoying it.  Go reading! wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions. is a little sick of poker... been playing Fallout 3 a lot last few days instead of poker all day... =) has left the country.  Enough poker at the WSOP, time to travel around a bit! just went paintballing in SD... always a great time!  The bruises go away after a few days, but the memories of capping your friends last a lifetime. 15k at bellagio today... off to the races wow... so many cool stories... boats r fun I'm now in Cannes for the tournament coming up in a couple days.  ... getting a little homesick, been gone almost 2 months taking care of last minute business... because tomorrow I'm going to Brazil =) is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten. thanks to my mom for an amazing feast... I just crashed out afterwards and caught up on 15 hours of sleep.  Now I'm up early in Poway and ready to go!  Who's out there??? is posting this from 30,000 feet above the surface of the earth, somewhere over nebraska in an airplane.  Wow, what an amazing world we live in! is back in vegas, ready to win the main event! ... not really b//c i'm never going to win a tournament.  hopefully I can take down a few $$$ anyways =) I think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard. thinks Backgammon is fun!! has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on *PROPNAME* to win vs *PROPNAME* to win against *PROPNAME*.  Any other winners is a tie. I figure *PROPNAME* is about 3:1 & *PROPNAME* is about 7.5:1 I loooove my bet right now (no odds!)  I wanted to book more action last night vs *PROPNAME* when I saw him at the Bellagio, but he doesn't like his side anymore.  Ship the EV kidd!!!!! is finally in Brazil after 2 whole days of travelling is thinking maybe he needs to go visit peeps at some point in Cali now that he's single and has no excuse not to.  Holla San Francisco & San Diego =)   ... Just gonna add that to my ToDo List here... get around to that at some point... (wow im hopeless) is up a little too early in the morning (9:30AM)... and doesn't know what to do with himself.  I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (*PROPNAME*)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solid wow... mass effect 2 just arrived.  //life read *PROPNAME*'s ""Check Raising the Devil"" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching ""The Universe"" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik back from vid's wedding.. it was a blast!  Congratulations to them both.  I am ready for some more high stakes gambling in Las Vegas.  One time! does not know anything about the destruction of any RVs outside of Las Vegas in the desert. is on a mission in the gym.  My body is changing daily, and I feel and think better then I have in a while.  Exercise: the only healthy drug! back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a reality"
