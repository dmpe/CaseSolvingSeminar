Question: What would have happened if Adam and Eve had eaten from the ""Tree of Life"" before eating from the ""Tree of Knowledge""? Things went better. *PROPNAME* was able to retain her composur and not break down in court. The judge referred the case to ""mediation"". We go to that Jan 29th. Well we are on hold until next Wed. Both CASA and CPS are demanding current prescription records all though they have through the last court date and did not request these until yesterday. *PROPNAME*'s theropist did not show either, but he is being supenaed for Wed. I'm ecstatic! I just spoke briefly with *PROPNAME*'s lawyer. Based on some ""case files"" I emailed her, we have enough evidence to prove CPS's removal of the kids was illegal and grounds for an emergency hearing. We believe we have enough evidence to cost both CPS and Humble PD their ""qualified immunity"", allowing us to file a civil suit against them and the apartments. ANYONE KNOW A GOOD CIVIL ATTORNEY??? Please keep *PROPNAME*'s family in your prayers tonight and tomorrow. We have to be in court at 9am. Really pray for the oldest *PROPNAME* went to his dad's for his summer visit and had his mother, brother and sister stripped from him for six months. CPS is providing Christmas for the other two but not him.  I sure hope we succeed at stripping them of their ""immunity"" and make them pay for what they've done to this family. *PROPNAME*'s kids won in KBXX-97.9 ""MADD HATTA'S ELVES"" Christmas contest. They get to go to an invitation only Christmas party at Dave & Busters Monday morning. Unfortunately. *PROPNAME*'s daddy does not want to let him go because of all the CPS stuff."

Looks like a good combination. Anyone have a need or desire for a (formerly stray) Red Tick Hound Dog? Apparently I read better while listening to Pink Floyd. Really helps with stimulating the mind. What an ordeal this has been. This dog is killing me. So hard to keep he and Sparky separated too... Bored...gonna go watch Thundercats on 50"". Exciting evening, eh? Mom woke me up today at noon; I was a little peeved. Stayed in bed for about ten minutes and went: Oh shit, it's Christmas isn't it. Completely forgot. Starting from chapter one and going from there. Thank you *PROPNAME*! Wow, already a two-hour delay. Almost killed myself trying to get a piece of non-existent parchment paper from my spider infested basement. Also, why would we buy Amish fruit salad? These are the questions Reading ""A Clockwork Orange"", and then on to ""Slaughter-House five""...probably Parkour: Not good to practice in the house. Just curious; if I'm so damn annoying with my vocabulary and ideas, might someone tell me why they talk to me exactly? Guess I might start using Facebook more then...So much info to port over. I'm going to sleep out of pure boredom. Goodbye for now, conscious world. New (temporary) dog in my house. Concerned about worms, for his sake and Sparky's."

No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder* had about 7L of insensible losses via mouth-breathing last night and woke up with a tongue the consistency of beef jerky. This viral URI can stick it up its tiny viral you-know-whoosy. Did anyone else think it was obvious *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* were getting a divorce like 34 seasons ago?

Apparently, all it takes for me to go on a semi-psychotic, cockroach-killing rampage is two glasses of wine and a strategically placed Dansko. I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head... thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch! Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT.

They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat. *PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN. I have spent a cumulative day reading ""The Hunger Games"" and its sequel, ""Catching Fire"" in the last week.

Christmas tree decorating. *PROPNAME* of the Bells. Potentially cocoa and//or holiday cookie baking. I am officially the worst Jew ever. Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing.

How about getting to bed early? Anyone want to jump on the bandwagon? 1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due. just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton. thinks it feels pretty fly to see her tiny shoots of arugula (and spinach, kale, and two types of lettuces) battling the odds! is pretty inspired by how active (and cool) some of her geriatrics patients are... I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms. Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends! Enjoying the lovely golden weekend! Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing ""The Menopause."" Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it... Anyone interested in joining me for *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME* on Oct. 22 at the Electric Factory?

Happy Holidays! *PROPNAME*'s tantrum has finally come to a close.  Phew!  (Read my note for more details ;) ) has only 8 more days to use the government's money.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them. had one of her worst nights ever at work, after spending all day actually believing today would be a good day.

Instead she had to unceremoniously toss them in the dumpster. You win some, you lose some. Week 2 doesn't say anything about the Playoffs. There's always next week. And lets be fair, the competition next week is the Chiefs. Ahahaha. is very glad to see that it's legitimately storming outside. If only she didn't have to go back to work in just a few minutes... proved her epic ninja skills tonight. took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise. has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer. is home from work and back to packing//cleaning. January 2nd can't come soon enough, because this is starting to get really monotonous. had an amazing night last night, in spite of the fact that she was literally falling asleep on her feet. would love to have something that even remotely resembles a reasonable sleep schedule. is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head.

Gas Station doughnut does not equal paczki, I almot cried a litle found my Tag paperwork in the man den...Hopefully I get my tags by 2.1 if I apply now online... Why are people from NeW Jersey so proud of being from New Jersey? here we go again...luckly I work at a school that may close for the chance of snow I was just watching ""*PROPNAME* in Real Life"" while I was working on my Christmas cards, and I just realized...*PROPNAME* (*PROPNAME*)  is the cop that pulls *PROPNAME* over and has his cruiser backed into.  HE IS WAY BETTER LOOKING WITHOUT THAT HAIR! Wow I am really in a funk...I had no idea *PROPNAME* was fired! I knew it was most likely going to be his last season, but I hardly ever miss stuff like that *PROPNAME* is flying into Chicago tonight...I will miss that guy! I just received an AARP card in the mail...not sure what to think Heading back to Atlanta... I did not realize that *PROPNAME* (the guy from ""to catch a predator"") went to MSU, that is actually pretty cool.  He is a bad ass in a turtleneck! my facebook looks the same...am I missing something? I hate to say this, but *PROPNAME* Tonight is actually pretty good...having a hard time chosing between that and *PROPNAME* Lately... I am hoping this is allergies and not a cold.. *PROPNAME* cant wait to dress up and go trick or treating! So the guito from Jersey Shore that calls him self ""The Situtation"" is trying to trademerk it now... Well, that wasnt so bad, now I have to wait and see... Apperantly the roads are bad in Atlanta...be careful out there guys! Watching basketball is giving me heartburn... I think quite possibly that MSU is one of the only teams in the Big Ten where the other team can have that many penalties and we still lose...the pizza pizza bowl is a GOAL now...and hockey is sucking a big one...when does basketball start? I am in a funk today...I dont know if it is depression, maybe a lack of motivation because of depression.  This process is not for the impatient. I would give my left ear to be able to watch the big ten network I ordered, thanks for ruinung my game day comcast... Breaking News: At the Atlanta Zoo, an old guy with a long white beard was caught try to lure 2 of each animal out of the exhibits.  It is also reported that he arrived in a large wooden boat... Big Game tonight..perfect big ten record on the line...GO GREEN! I fell on the way to my car this morning...I hope that is not the predictor of a bad day! black Errands...

Also HAPPY 11th BIRTHDAY MAX!  no matter how old you get you will still be a whiny pain in the ass to me puppy Getting ready for my suprize trip to MI...I wish it was under better circumstances Well, if I dont root for the Colts I am pretty sure that *PROPNAME* will never talk to me again, and  we need him at trivia for Sports questions, so GO COLTS! Well, I think he has the flu, but it is basically impossible to tell if he has the swine flu Even though my own sister is a blood traider....GO GREEN!!  GO ND!!! What makes *PROPNAME* so special!!  He is a QUITTER!  Watch out *PROPNAME*... Almost the weekend...only a few more short hours...I think we can make it. Well, I didnt see that coming... This rain has gotten me down today, that and the fact that my flat iron died...bad hair and I am cranky...At least I can look forward to Glee tonight! I am feeling strangely homesick from thinking about my birthday...I havent had a good one since college...maybe i will just stop trying to make it special Keep your fingers crossed that *PROPNAME* kept his germs to himself... The ""Full House"" home is on the market for 4 mil.  I wonder if being fetured in the show increased its value Happy St Valentines Day! Damn it, I am old...sitting here in my snuggie watching a telathon... Rest in Peace Uga the Bulldog, the world of college mascots morns you today Three Flakes and schools are closed tomorrow?  WEAK Has anyone else noticed that the dolphin with the helmet on the Miami Dolphins logo looks like it should be riding the short bus? And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesnt come from a store. What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more. Well, this year has to be better then the last... now I kinda wish it was snowing...just for over night, then after I am able to enjoy it over a cup of coffee then it can vanish! My thanksgiving utopia lasted a whole hour...new record. Back in the ATL, but still just as foggy...luckly work is falling into place without me even doing anything... DANG IT!!  If you are in Atlanta and need somehere to go for NYE, come to my house, I have food and drink, almost all of my guests are sick or have sick kids! Thank-you everyone for your bithday wishes, they made me feel truely special Today I am thankful that I am able to be in Michigan with my family.  I am also thankful for my families in Michigan and in Atlanta.  I am most thankful for everyone I love being healthy today. ""Over the river and to the woods to Boosha's house we go!"" Just another day... My mouth always gets me in trouble... What is going on with this bowl game?  I thought that MSU losing 20% of thier players was bad...now texas tech coach scandle?   If you were going to toss a kid in the closet...would you chose the one whose dad is on tv everynight??  Bad call dude! So apperently the owners at my school have decided that they want to make things as complicated as possible...enter new and stupidly expensive computer program!

Dropping off some resumes today...I am feeling good mojo! I am so so excited...Going to the big game...heading home...going to see my dog...I cant sleep! Day looking up, I will be able to exchange the defective flat iron!  I realized that New Moon comes out when I will be home for Thanksgiving, any body want to go see it with me?  Still looking forward to Glee...I feel a little dirty thinking that *PROPNAME* is hot So my dome light will not go out when I am driving, I actually reasched the problem myself and sent *PROPNAME* out to spray the crap out of my door latches with wd40...I cannot believe I was on a forum looking up car stuff... wow, nothing like losing to a MAC team to make me cry...I would like to thank pete for ruining the game for me as well...jurk...

She seems ok today, no weird movements, eating and drinking, and her cagemate is acting normal...I read online that strokes are common but it doesnt sound like they bounce back that quick... Oh no *PROPNAME* is really sick, I even made him chicken soup yesterday, and he still is running a fever! I am dreading glee this week... *PROPNAME* mixed week old coucous with new coucous, and he cannot understand why I will not eat it...

Not until just now...oops blue is making rice krispies treats! is watching ""The Proposal"". *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*...even if the movie is crap it won't be a total waste:) starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later is doing some major housecleaning! is annoyed that GM decided it would be cool to have some stupid ass bracket for wiper blades on the G6 resulting in me having to pay $70 for replacement blades. is excited about my helicopter shaped cookie cutter:) mmm peppermint mocha coffee creamer:) shooting and punching some stuff in Borderlands:) doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:) is getting very excited about decorating for Christmas! We are heading out to get a tree and all that fun stuff in a while:) went to see ""The Hangover"" tonight then came home to enjoy a nice relaxing jacuzzi tub bath with a glass of wine...life doesn't get much better than that! is off to the gym! can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo! had a great day with a wonderful friend and a wonderful evening with a great boyfriend. I'm one lucky girl:) I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes. off to the store to get the things I need to make caramel apple cookies. I hope that mine turn out as good as the picture! I also hope that they have the caramel bits I need at this Walmart! Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:) has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug! If *PROPNAME* San Diego and *PROPNAME* ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible. wasn't very impressed with ""Taking of Pelham 123"" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.  Ha would like to know why our water is off is nervous about getting cavities filled for the first time ever tomorrow:( The up side is that it probably isn't as bad as repair work from stepping on a shovel;) There I feel a bit better now! just had a wonderful chat with *PROPNAME* on the phone and is about to start making dinner:) is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay! accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone! is not happy that our A//C is not working. Grrrr is happily watching Pixar short films on abc family while my DVR records *PROPNAME* on another channel:) Oh and I'm drinking my pumpkin spice coffee too! Life is good! is a huge nerd and posting books on paperback swap:) plans to sit on the couch watching movies all day. is happy to finally be home for a while after lots of running around lately! is making some grub feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames! doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Californication"" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other ""Dysfunctional family dramas""  This includes ""Dexter"" and ""Rescue Me"" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well. is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool. has a cold:( Happy Thanksgiving everybody! I'm thankful for friends to share Thanksgiving with:) Now time to make some yummy food to share later doing some online Christmas shopping had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:) is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:( *PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!! Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said ""Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)..ummm...Goonies"" thinks it might be time for a nap:) had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:) perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :) Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now! Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit"

199,d7e500ad854a1b6ced39e53a525b8a6d,"Is still pretty much on facebook hiatus...if you message me I'll probably answer though. Otherwise, most of you know where to find me! Spacemen 3 are pretty good...but in moderation--too many songs in a row and they'll put you to sleep! Zzzzz... Sleepytime at last!  Bundled up in blankets like fuckin' Jesus inna manger.  Or medieval couples that weren't sposed to fuck yet, lol.  Fuck off, snow! Bah! Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind. Supposedly Hauppauge means ""land of sweet water.""  Somehow I doubt the water's very ""sweet"" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district... Hopin' I'll sleep tonight! Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being! hates crying, hates her health (or lack thereof), hates snow, and hates Christmas and its trappings of tomfoolery.  Today has become a day of hate. *angry pout* My body may be a medical nightmare, but at least it leaves me hangover-free for some reason, hah!  Glad to see everyone last night...thanks all for the *loves* and for those who were kind in the face of my drunken overhonesty, oy. My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb. ... Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again! Sick of this nihilistic depression shit--fine, life may be meaningless, I may be right about all the other disturbingly bleak shit I've been thinking...but I'm not a self-killer so I'm stuck here--might as well pull it together and live this crazy life I've got anyway, eh?  Some change is in the works (just in time for the New Year, ironically). This morning my dad said ""it smells weird in your apartment.""  Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh... Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise! Sunday bloody Sunday...booooring...! is trying not to be grumpy. My, how the randomness abounds!...but I need some sleep. 2 people today mentioned that my Wall is disabled from being posted on...I didn't even know! Lol, changed it...post at will I guess. *shrug!* In other news...YAY CARTOONS! ""YEEES, we have no// bananas// todaaaaayyy!"" Oy, Jiminator--this bring back any college memories, lol? ""I got BLOOD on my hands and there's no remorse; I got BLOOD on my DICK cause I fucked a corpse..."" When I hear it I think of you, haha! :D Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya... Waking from a really good dream into harsh reality is one of the great cruelties of life.  *groggy and disgruntled* Got to be 'early to rise' tomorrow, so I'ma try to be 'early to bed' tonight...thusly, going to bed now; we'll see how that goes! Bev quote of the hour: ""Bah, the chaos gods can suck my intangible throbbing member."" Errghhh...insomnia suuuuucks! *whines, ears begin to bleed* is sick as a dog & about to go home early...bluhhhh Doing enough work to compensate for being in Atlanta Thursday & Friday...blehhhh.  (Still at work at frickin' midnight!)  But the trip, the company & the brief respite from LI will be soooo bloody appreciated. doesn't know what to think. Sorry I had to bail so early on Sanctuary last night, folks...sick & tired does not a fun Bev make--sittin' in the corner like ol' granny watchin' the kiddies play outside! *scrunches nose* Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick* Sweet respite... *snooze* WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe! Ehh...bite me! It just occurred to me that two of my favorite songs are punk songs about gruesome abortions (""Bodies"" by Sex Pistols and ""Die of Shame"" by Tilt)...man, I'm just not quite right, lol! Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space... *zoned the fuck out* Well...if my interactions and happenings of last night were any indication, 2010 may well be a pretty good year...but we'll see!  Happy new year, love y'all! :D Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D BRRR!  ""Stiff Little Fingers"" indeed! Happy thingy, people... Tis the season to cough up weird stuff...yecch. Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning. is so glad I finally tried a chiropractor!  My back hasn't felt this good in ages!  I was very crackly, lol. 2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...) Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.) Today's stream of consciousness: Hooray for comic books, poetry and nerds in general...forgot my phone at home today, blargh (couldn't reach me, that's why)...swamped at work...pretzels suck...missing NOLA (especially the Quarter) alot today for some reason...""the holidays"" are annoying me already...Wikipedia is addictive...so is Facebook, gods help me...! Bored with cartoons & porn...time to sleep I guess. *blink, shrug, yawn* is checking her facebook a little more than she used to...but facebook still bombards her with more information than she has time to fool with!  Taking things at a glance. Taken off the troublesome med! Back to Bev as usual now I guess. Black. doesn't get it--even when I get enough sleep, I run out of energy LONG before the day is over...what gives?!  This rampant exhaustion really puts a cramp on my life & times...and now I'm gonna go sleep some more.  Hmph! Feelin' pretty lousy today...basically zombie-ing through work, and not in the fun way.  I feel like part of my brain is missing and has been replaced by canned air.  Bleah...Monday is definitely my least favorite day! might have contracted the rockin' pneumonia...but I hope I don't get the boogie-woogie flu--it sounds repulsive!  By the way, I hate that song. (No, I'm not sick...I'm just a weirdo!) Feeling DAMN GOOD headwise lately: forceful self-change of outlook, meds seem to be finally working, & I'm startin to get shit done! 'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy! is relaxing... ""Is it special when you're lonely// do you spend your whole life// in a studio apartment// with a cat for a wife// The seasons, when they call you// do you barricade the door// are you stubborn, stubborn, stubborn to the core?...Then the longest winter// is on her way// you called her without knowing it// but now it's too late..."" Trying to keep the zen, but it's hard to hang onto sometimes on nights like these. Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch. He says the Wizard is a prick, by the way.  And, ""Look! Look, Bev, they dropped a fuckin' house on her!!"" Whew. isn't gonna fool with facebook applications, but does check facebook briefly every day now, for what it's worth... About to go to bed so I can get up early to check out a car tomorrow morn...*crosses fingers* hope this one pans out; the longer I'm trapped, vehicleless, the more likely I am to go completely bloody mad! Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh... Dammit dammit I can't SLEEP!  Awake all night then tried to fall asleep for 4 hours.  At least if I had hypothermia I'd fall unconscious...hmm.  But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise! has a tummyache (again, stupid tummy) but is otherwise alright! Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under ""O"" for ""Owwww""* Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah! I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like! Gah, bus schedules are confusing! *scratches head, which then explodes* Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment! Went to the latest Disney cartoon with my dad tonight...it was set in New Orleans and it was surprisingly pretty good. But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech. Trying everything I can to get rid of it quickly! God damn it...I need for my laptop to NOT freeze for 10 minutes before deciding to perhaps or perhaps not perform the command I've clicked...I need a car that isn't a fucking pretzel, or at least SOME form of viable transportation...I need ADD meds that don't leave me staring off into fucking space at work...GAHHH!  Very fucking frustrated!  Anyone with input re laptop or car, please comment...*sigh* Well, meds situation is not ideal by any means (zombieish again) but it's a vast improvement on the last few days of horror! Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination. Getting another potential car checked out by my mechanic tomorrow...god I hope one of these fucking things works out soon! *blows up apartment* Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.  Getting the fuck outta LI, seeing my superawesome folks, finally getting some proper southern food, and maybe even checking out Decatur nightlife & Williams Street...the word of the day is ""YAAAYYYYY!"" Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but ""I'M NOT DEAD YET!!"" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed* ""Got an animated corpse//at my beck & call//you will find my skin cells underneath his fingernails//Carpet fibers from my car//Covering his coat and clinging to his follicles//Everyday we meet//Plot fourteen//As he hops in the front in the seat next to me//He can't wait til I tell him what I need//Then he nods a rotting head and then I set him free"" My foot is asleep...maybe it's trying to tell me I should be asleep, too...*conks* Went and got the last of my stuff out of my...car...(read: twisted metal heap with fuzzy seats) this morning.  It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though... Meow? Eh, why the hell not:  THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. Lets see how honest my FB friends are. Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes ME. It can only be 1 word. No more than 1 word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. Wonder how many brave friends will do this. *sigh* Off to prepare for a night of festivitation...2010 here we come, haharr! Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much. ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again. ""Just another manic Monday""...nah, not really--if I was manic right now I'd probably be getting alot more done, lol! Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from. Oddly enough, my skin was better when I was a teenager than it is now! is now friends with I NEED A FUCKING CAR!!! ""Woo-hah! Woo-hah! Got you all in check!"" LOL Faring alright, I s'pose...just sore, and scouring the universe for used Toyotas & Hondas...  Need transportation, STAT!  Anyone with input on the car front, please comment!  Hope everyone's Halloween rocked... Ugh...headache and some amount of nervousness.  Resurrection tomorrow night though, yay!  Night all... Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. :// What's black and green and red all over?  Me after the GWAR show, YEAH! XD  Time for the sleep of a lifetime now, though...damn. Today's sky is as grey as my default mood setting.  Sometimes it's rather exhausting being so exquisitely angst-ridden...*rolls eyes, sighs* Holy shit, the sky is falling: my dad actually CHEERED ME UP out of a tough spot for once!  Maybe he's learning!  Or maybe it was a fluke...either way, I feel a lot better now!  :)  Dammit someone find me a good yoga studio now, lol! I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated. I'm back from Atlanta, over 24 hours after I was s'posed to be...am worn the fuck out.  But had a great fuckin' time down there before the airtravel assraping!  So, yay to that! ;D Have good weekend, meine leibschen, yes yes!  I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!) Hoping this insane wind doesn't blow me away to Oz...those Munchkins might've gone feral by now. *shudder* ""I said he's a fairy I do suppose//flyin thru the air in pantyhose//he may be very sexy or even cute//but he looks like a sucka in a blue and red suit//I said you need a man who's got finesse//& his whole name across his chest//he may be able to fly all thru the night//but can he rock a party til the early light//he can't satisfy you with his little worm//but I can bust you out w my Super sperm!!"" Rapper's Delight on Superman *sneeze, cough, snort* Blech!  Trying that Airborne shit TONIGHT!  At least I'm getting the screechy car fixed today.  Now if I could only find gloves that match eachother...*wearing one black leather glove and one knit blue striped glove* Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?! The Mighty Boosh is completely mad but completely awesome. It has soothed my disgruntled sadness with its peculiar brand of British inanity...and interpretive dance. *nodnod* It liiiives!!!  (Meds adjusted--we'll see if I stay awake today! *blinkblink*) Meh.  Humans are a fickle species. Yes, I have no bananas...I have no bananas todayyyyy! is very well-rested, lol. Gah...sick of feeling like crap! Gods deliver me from resilient falltime ailments...*brandishes stick menacingly...then gets dizzy and passes out* Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol... is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment! Second half of last week quite sucked and was uneventful to boot...may this week be an improvement!  *kicks suckiness repeatedly with pointy!pointy!shoes* It's insane how much time one has to spend on the telephone with basically everyone in Christendom after a big car accident...blahhhh...deliver me from being on hold all day! *glares at phone* Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me ""Was machts du gerade"" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :P Unproductive day...home sick & made no money, and no progress carwise...but at least I got some rest, I guess. *sigh* is sick of the pain. *sigh* ...and now back to my regularly scheduled severe dangerously-nihilistic depression. :D!!!1!1!!!1!!!!one! It's a DK kind of day. *nod* will probably be taking a hiatus from facebook again for a bit...you know where to reach me if you wish to do so! Heh...:""God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong! I hate people!//I hate the human race//I hate people!//I hate your ugly face//I hate people!//I hate your fucking mess//I hate people!//They hate me!""-Anti-Nowhere League I mean to go to bed early (to get over the Plague of Atlanta), and yet I end up staying up all night doing practically nothing.  Story of my life.  Hmph!

(My preciousssss...)  But DUDE, who saw the Metalocalypse season premiere?  When that ""surprise thing"" happened I literally screamed in joy (woke up my dad, lol)!  Maybe semi-expected but still, WOOT! *shrug* Eh. Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears. ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche Checking out a car in the morning...hope it checks out--I'm not enjoying this carless whatnottery! WTF...did I like, get Mono or something in Atlanta (and how would I get Mono there? I don't make out with my relatives, ew!)?  I've felt consistently crappy and out of it ever since I came back.  Meh.  In other news, thanks to Lorna, I have ""Unpack Your Adjectives"" stuck in my head, lol... The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe... Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face* Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!! I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off! Feeling pretty good since the whole 'tweaking my outlook' kick I've been on...except for this sore throat//sniffles thing, geh. But I'll live...hey, drinking tea goes along with the zen thing anyway, lol."

Allergy season for *PROPNAME* is commencing...  *hack*hack*hack*   :P   I'm not contagious, promise! This hair-brainedness needs to cease... NOW.  :P Wow, even in 1963, *PROPNAME* was ranting about the ""half-wit morons up in Sacramento"" (just watch It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World) Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year???  What was at the OC county fair?  I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair...  ;) Just to be clear: Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries.  :D Missed the forest and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too.  :P Cold weather, lack of sunshine and fog all breed pestilence... Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence (knock on wood), but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches. Going through everyone's status messages from last night... yeah, so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:P Pipe dream for the day: Being a Wagnerian soprano.  I can shriek but not in tune.  :P Already sleepy time again...  I blame lunch from Bread Store. Ears are being blown out by two trombone players... sure, they're classically trained and playing Holst's ""Mars, the Bringer of War"", but it HURTS.  :P Sorry, People magazine... your ""sexy"" guys can't hold a candle to the men of the 40s, 50s and 60s... *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*...

I might actually get a little sun... don't worry I'll have sunscreen =) wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons.

If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten. does not know anything about the destruction of any RVs outside of Las Vegas in the desert. finished Fooled by Randomness... it's an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone.  I'm now 80 pages into Chaos by *PROPNAME* and am enjoying it.  Go reading! read *PROPNAME*'s ""Check Raising the Devil"" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching ""The Universe"" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik is a little sick of poker... been playing Fallout 3 a lot last few days instead of poker all day... =)"
