We believe we have enough evidence to cost both CPS and Humble PD their ""qualified immunity"", allowing us to file a civil suit against them and the apartments. ANYONE KNOW A GOOD CIVIL ATTORNEY??? Can anyone out there tell me if Jesus was EVER anointed in OIL? He was babtized in water and anointed in the Holy Spirt which is why he is called the ""anointed one"". Can anyone tell me yes or no. If yes I need scripture reference. Thank you. Could teenage ""Huffing"" be the result of modern day child proofing and the parent neglecting to actually teach the child, ""THAT WILL KILL YOU""."

That is not trusting the nowness properly that what is the actual experience now possesses a lot of powerful things. It is so powerful that we can't face it.

I bet I'll hardly ever use it. Almost killed myself trying to get a piece of non-existent parchment paper from my spider infested basement. Also, why would we buy Amish fruit salad? These are the questions Guess I might start using Facebook more then...So much info to port over. Reading ""A Clockwork Orange"", and then on to ""Slaughter-House five""...probably The French have redeemed themselves as a nationality with the invention of Parkour! bought ""Season 1"" of the old Thundercats cartoon; watching the shit out of this old nostalgic favorite right now. On an unrelated note, I have TONS of homework. Looks like a good combination. Watching a bunch of movies. I'm starting with ""The Quiet Earth"" Mom woke me up today at noon; I was a little peeved. Stayed in bed for about ten minutes and went: Oh shit, it's Christmas isn't it. Completely forgot. Gonna read ""SHF"" Facebook is very hard to navigate with everything written like a pirate.

Ok, the new *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME* is kind of amazing. NOW who is coming with me on 10//22? *PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're ""way stronger than you think"" at doing bicep curls.

Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-) 34,865 Kleenex and some codeine later, Kea rejoins the world of the living... Well, it finally happened: I bought a coffee so big it didn't fit in my microwave for re-heating. (Sub-status update: Go to bing.com for some major Boston pride ;-) Out into the cool fall air for lots of mocha and a little studying. Almost just passed out in the library trying to test my Valsalva//baroreceptor//HR reflex. And no, my reflex is NOT intact, thankyouforasking. Frick! Just burned out. Really, USMLE World? You really want me to know which growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and which ones need JAK//STAT for signal transduction? I poop on you. Sunday. *PROPNAME* gone. And the person standing in line behind me at the minimart, who saw me paying with a bill that had a giant inappropriate anatomical figure on it, was a pastor. Of course. Who's gonna see the Harry Potter movie with me? The person who comes is still allowed to judge me. If this societal obsession with vampires had happened while I was going through my ""phase"" in middle school, it really could have changed my life. So like, what's the deal with *PROPNAME*? I think I'm missing a basic understanding of this cultural phenomenon. wishes the weekend would never end =) had about 7L of insensible losses via mouth-breathing last night and woke up with a tongue the consistency of beef jerky. This viral URI can stick it up its tiny viral you-know-whoosy. took the first step toward developing a green thumb today. Windowbox basil, anyone? Buy a Christmas//Hannukah//Kwanzaa//Solstice tree? Check. Get Step 1 books? Check. Start dinner before 10pm? Check. It's really amazing what we can accomplish when we're let out of surgery early! Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends! Did anyone else think it was obvious *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* were getting a divorce like 34 seasons ago? just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton. finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat. Halfway done with med school and off to the Outer Banks for two weeks. Limited access to phone and e-mail, but will check when I can! CONGRATS classmates! I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms. No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder* Meh. Had a dream last night that I defied the laws of the space-time continuum. Isn't that like the holy grail of dreams? is sick =( just canceled out the vote of an obnoxious, be-cashmere-scarved prettyman chanting ""*PROPNAME*, hare krishna, *PROPNAME*"" in the middle of Starbucks. Health care for all! ""Cuz when the roof caved in and the truth came out I just didn't know what to doooo, But when I become a star we'll be living so large I'll do anything for youuuu..."". On repeat. I don't care if this makes me a loser. Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU. Who dat?! just typed ""loves 30 Rock so much it hurts sometimes"" into the FB search box. I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point. Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing. I had SUCH good taste in movies as a high schooler, holy crap! And now I like The Holiday?! is officially more than halfway done studying for Step 1. Yikos. Note to self: Trying to rekindle an old flame for string cheese is not well accomplished using low-salt, skim mozarella sticks. would rather be potting. Even after 10 hours in the studio this weekend... Turned the heat on, finally. Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...) caved. How did fall completely slip through the crack between summer and winter? Santa must LOVE me; St. John bound in T-11 days! Sunday blues. thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch! watched in shock today as a nurse on the bus poked and yelled at an old, disabled man for sitting too close to her in the section designated for old and disabled people. Wishing I'd said something. Hooked on Weeds without any way of getting my next dose soon. Damn you, Netflix instant queue and your empty promises. *PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN. I have spent a cumulative day reading ""The Hunger Games"" and its sequel, ""Catching Fire"" in the last week. And now I can't study because I'm pining for the final book in the series, which won't come out til August. Damn you, *PROPNAME*, and your cruel attempt to get me reading again! If there had been a real fire tonight, everyone in my building (including me) would be burned to a crisp right now because apparently a fire alarm isn't enough to lure us from our dens. Seriously going insane. Actually wishing I could move up my date to spare myself the psychological nightmare of last-minute USMLE studying. Me: ""Omg I am tired after two robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingoopherectomies. *PROPNAME*: ""Awesome I did a fatakanicous dilopidous internal rectomy today too.""

Hm. Apparently running for the first time in months makes me simultaneously feel like horse $#!@ and want to devour a steak. Wasn't prepared for that. 1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad s library nemesis has answered her pine nut brittle with chips, a paper lunch bag, and a thinly-veiled apology for his ""snack attack."" Touché, library nemesis, touché. Brokeback is officially the most depressing movie of all time. has 10 times more respect for *PROPNAME* after her crazy bra lady moves. Herioc indeed. can't decide if it's good or bad that med students score worse than a monkey randomly choosing an answer for some of these USMLE questions... Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it... I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head... Days becoming so much shorter... s mind was just completely blown by the awesomeness of Zahav (Israeli restaurant here). Easily in the top three restaurants I've eaten at, worldwide. Go there. Now. Very slowly meandering my way toward garden bliss. Does anyone in Philly have a patio umbrella they're trying to rid themselves of, by chance?"

I think I might cry cause I really, REALLY wanted to go..... why did I ask for snow? I only wanted a little! City of Angels hads reconfirmed my belief that *PROPNAME* is AWESOME. is thinking that the poor girls doing that ""single ladies"" are getting dissed too much. I've seen younger girls doing lewder dances with less clothes.

To top it all off, I got a call from the clinic saying that I'm anemic, and they want to put me on yet ANOTHER iron supplement that I can't afford. FTW.

You got me singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster with capabilities to destroy the entire universe. doesn't know how to cope with all of this stress... I think I've cried about 10 times in the last 3 days... thinks that she needs some numbers from friends. hopes they schedule her C-Section at her doctor's appointment on Wednesday. is thinking hard and excited for her new Xanga layout! 6 more days....

Really. ""knowledge without repentance will be but a torch to light your way to hell"" A prospering tree does not eat it's own fruit. A prospering tree produces fruit that others might eat. wonders at the absolute absurdity of man's hatred...Christ summed up all the goodness we are capable of in two commands...none of us even follows just one of them.

There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now. People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat. If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination.

The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives. think..see. ..act...

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.

It's simply that I just have to grilling with the battalion Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work. Common sense is instinct.

Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it. I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable. It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listeners Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it. Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves. Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail .if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin phones dead stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place. There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do. The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward. working on calculus The average estimate themselves by what they do, the above average by what they are What is opportunity to the man who can't use it? We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable Dream as if you have forever. Live as if you only have today I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes Your             problem is that you think you have time No bees, no honey; no work, no money. There is no squabbling so violent as that between people who accepted an idea yesterday and those who will accept the same idea tomorrow. perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen Calc, History, comp, then chem Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF? height and weight test under bravo A failure establishes only this, that our determination to succeed was not strong enough The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing. Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round  remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten need to do calc got my battle rattle ready"

145,a8295e7c5a427770f9777a825e6daf35,"Todays flight will being heading from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to Dever International Airport. Our approximate time in the air will be about two hours and thirty minutes reaching an altitude of 35,000 feet (Flight level 350). I'd like to personally thank you for flying Frontier Airlines. Flight attendants, prepare for take off. We have seen them wear purple for four Sundays, maybe even rose for one of those Sundays. We have prepared our heart, mind, and soul. We now await for His coming... ""O Emmanuel, king and lawgiver, desire of the nations, Savior of all people, come and set us free, Lord our God."" ""Make sure your seat-backs and trays are in their up-right and lock positions and thank you for flying American Airlines. Flight attendants...prepare for take off."" Seventh day of Christmas!!! I still hear the church bells ringing and Handel's Hallelujah Chorus!! Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to all good men!!! Just played and sang a buch of Chirstmas music for a General of the United Sates Air Force's reception. There were so many ""big-wigs"" there and it was a blast. Not to mention there was a cute girl bartending...great night. I am being called to be a man of the cloth. But is that what I will be happy doing? God or the girl? One and a half how drive in unplowed interstate roads at 0330 hrs., deicing of a plane, take off, crusing at flight level 330, tiny airplane...but at least I am headed to 80 degree weather. The temperature in Denver is 6 degrees. Brr ""The star burnned like a flame, pointing the way to God, the King of kings; the wise men saw the sign and brought their gifts in homage to their great King.""  ""Seeing the star, the wise men said: This must signify the birth of some great king. Let us search for him and lay treasures at his feet: gold, frankincense, and myrrh."" The Monastery of Our Lady of the Holy Spirit in Conyers, Georgia was so beautiful. There is nothing like waking up at 4 o'clock for vigils, a morning prayer prayed in the Liturgy of the Hours. Then have lauds mixed with Mass...beautiful! Why do we give people titles because of what they do and not who they are? This is what bothers me, but maybe I'm just waiting for a world that sees people not for what they do but who they are. Just a lazy day on the lake...if only the rain would stop so I could go out on the lake."
146,ab10a89d4fa299fe348a3ee1d183b3ee,"Quite possibly the worst couple days ever: yesterday almost cried at work. I apparently have the 2 worst classes in the school- lowest freshman math. Who I see for four periods.  And which stole a student's wallet. I was totally freaked out tonight while driving home with Janice at 12am. The black coupe next to me matched my speed even though I was going fast and then he continued to match me speed as I slowed down. So I turn to look at the driver of the car and he's wearing a mask. A rubber mask reminiscent to freddy cruger. 0_0 I almost had a heart attack. I then slowed down a lot and he continued on... oh my goodness... Then at Costco tonight, I find out my atm card is blocked due to potential fraud. Now I need to stop by the bank tomorrow for a temporary card... I wonder if this qualifies for fml... In my 10 min stop at 85*C bakery in Irvine, I saw 4 people I knew..."

I'm thankful for friends to share Thanksgiving with:) Now time to make some yummy food to share later *PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!! feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames! did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house. didn't think that coming to take care of the water heater first thing in the morning meant 11...I guess there's still 45 mins until it afternoon! can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo! is excited about dinner and movie date night:) wonders how sick Bon Jovi is of singing this song is feeling productive after posting *PROPNAME*'s care on autotrader. If anyone is possibly interested in a 2006 Honda Civic Si for ~$13500 let me know. I will post the link too once it's officially up on the site! just finished watching ""The Ugly Truth"", cute movie:) really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me. is happy to have a new working DirecTV box. I can open the guide and switch channels without it freezing....and the DVR works. I can now go back to waiting until a few minutes into a show before I start watching and then fast forward through commercials! Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now! almost time to make white chicken chili with cheddar jalepeno hushpuppy crust. It's going to be even better than usual 'cause we finally have some fall weather here! accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone! is making sweet potatoe split pea soup. I hope it's good! is making rice krispies treats! Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it! is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay! If *PROPNAME* San Diego and *PROPNAME* ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible. is wondering how many people get themselves screwed out of money by not paying attention and keeping records of stuff. I just added another $70 to my ""um no dumby actually I don't owe you that money"" total. Yay me:) Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f**k was going on when I first saw it. is glad that we waited to watch Wolverine as a rental. is off to the gym! doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:) was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*! Bad news: Novocaine is wearing off so my mouth is hurting a bit now. Good news: I can now drink my pumpkin spice latte without dribbling:) is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;) is getting very excited about decorating for Christmas! We are heading out to get a tree and all that fun stuff in a while:) set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken! is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool."

But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise!

But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech.

I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!) Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly! Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. :// Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol... *sneeze, cough, snort* Blech!  Trying that Airborne shit TONIGHT!  At least I'm getting the screechy car fixed today.  Now if I could only find gloves that match eachother...*wearing one black leather glove and one knit blue striped glove* doesn't know what to think.

Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment! Had bad dreams last night, some sobering thoughts on my mind...yet I'm still in a good mood today.  I don't get it, but I'm not complaining! It's amazing what you'll watch on TV when you stay up all night. My foot is asleep...maybe it's trying to tell me I should be asleep, too...*conks* ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again. Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much. is very well-rested, lol. Bev quote of the hour: ""Bah, the chaos gods can suck my intangible throbbing member."" Ugh...headache and some amount of nervousness.  Resurrection tomorrow night though, yay!  Night all... is sick of the pain. Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face* Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me! needs a change. Anyone know any yoga studios in or close to the Smithtown//Kings Park area? Gotta find my zen again! hates crying, hates her health (or lack thereof), hates snow, and hates Christmas and its trappings of tomfoolery.  Today has become a day of hate. *angry pout* Sweet respite... *snooze* Why do I insist on eating popsicles in winter?  OM NOM NOM Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh... Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose! Heh...:""God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong!

This morning my dad said ""it smells weird in your apartment.""  Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh... URGENT!!  Does anyone want to see SONIC YOUTH with DINOSAUR JR. TONIGHT at Terminal 5 in Manhattan (show starts 8 PM)??  Sean is sick and can't go so I have a FREE TICKET to the show, which is SOLD OUT otherwise.  If you're interested, drop me a text!! 631-714-9319. I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off! Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch. He says the Wizard is a prick, by the way.  And, ""Look! Look, Bev, they dropped a fuckin' house on her!!"" Me da is my hero right now...he found me some fucking NYQUIL!!  25 hours awake is waaaay more than enough (especially when I'm sick).  Going to go smoke with the ghost in the back of my head (heyy, random little-remembered song reference!).  GOODNIGHT FOLKS!! Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick* Getting ready for ma belle *PROPNAME*'s birthday whatnottery...may I not fall asleep face-down in cake this evening!*crosses fingers* Feeling pretty good since the whole 'tweaking my outlook' kick I've been on...except for this sore throat//sniffles thing, geh. But I'll live...hey, drinking tea goes along with the zen thing anyway, lol. Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again! Ehh...bite me! ""And life is thorny, and youth is vain; And to be wroth with ones we love doth work like madness in the brain.""--Samuel Taylor Coleridge Went and got the last of my stuff out of my...car...(read: twisted metal heap with fuzzy seats) this morning.  It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though... Holy shit, the sky is falling: my dad actually CHEERED ME UP out of a tough spot for once!  Maybe he's learning!  Or maybe it was a fluke...either way, I feel a lot better now!  :)  Dammit someone find me a good yoga studio now, lol! Never enough Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!! The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe... ""I said he's a fairy I do suppose//flyin thru the air in pantyhose//he may be very sexy or even cute//but he looks like a sucka in a blue and red suit//I said you need a man who's got finesse//& his whole name across his chest//he may be able to fly all thru the night//but can he rock a party til the early light//he can't satisfy you with his little worm//but I can bust you out w my Super sperm!!"" Rapper's Delight on Superman WTF...did I like, get Mono or something in Atlanta (and how would I get Mono there? I don't make out with my relatives, ew!)?  I've felt consistently crappy and out of it ever since I came back.  Meh.  In other news, thanks to Lorna, I have ""Unpack Your Adjectives"" stuck in my head, lol... Almost forgot it was Sunday night...yay for new Venture Bros. eps!  (My preciousssss...)  But DUDE, who saw the Metalocalypse season premiere?  When that ""surprise thing"" happened I literally screamed in joy (woke up my dad, lol)!  Maybe semi-expected but still, WOOT! *shrug* Eh. ""Yes yes yes, effervescently meaningless..."" Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah! Today's stream of consciousness: Hooray for comic books, poetry and nerds in general...forgot my phone at home today, blargh (couldn't reach me, that's why)...swamped at work...pretzels suck...missing NOLA (especially the Quarter) alot today for some reason...""the holidays"" are annoying me already...Wikipedia is addictive...so is Facebook, gods help me...! MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHURRRRRGHHHHHHHH..... Supposedly Hauppauge means ""land of sweet water.""  Somehow I doubt the water's very ""sweet"" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district... is so glad I finally tried a chiropractor!  My back hasn't felt this good in ages!  I was very crackly, lol. is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment! Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination. Black. Oy, Jiminator--this bring back any college memories, lol? ""I got BLOOD on my hands and there's no remorse; I got BLOOD on my DICK cause I fucked a corpse..."" When I hear it I think of you, haha! :D Sleepytime at last!  Bundled up in blankets like fuckin' Jesus inna manger.  Or medieval couples that weren't sposed to fuck yet, lol.  Fuck off, snow! 2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...) I lahk the cut o' yerr jib...*licks teeth creepily* ""Got an animated corpse//at my beck & call//you will find my skin cells underneath his fingernails//Carpet fibers from my car//Covering his coat and clinging to his follicles//Everyday we meet//Plot fourteen//As he hops in the front in the seat next to me//He can't wait til I tell him what I need//Then he nods a rotting head and then I set him free"" Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya... It liiiives!!!  (Meds adjusted--we'll see if I stay awake today! *blinkblink*) Bored with cartoons & porn...time to sleep I guess. *blink, shrug, yawn* If I'm stuck in the house long enough, maybe I'll clean it!  That's looking on the bright side I guess...at least I'm in a better mood and a little less ill than yesterday, though maybe a little stir crazy--I found myself dancing to the Baskin *PROPNAME* 'ice cream and cake' commercial, lol! Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise! doesn't get it--even when I get enough sleep, I run out of energy LONG before the day is over...what gives?!  This rampant exhaustion really puts a cramp on my life & times...and now I'm gonna go sleep some more.  Hmph! God damn it...I need for my laptop to NOT freeze for 10 minutes before deciding to perhaps or perhaps not perform the command I've clicked...I need a car that isn't a fucking pretzel, or at least SOME form of viable transportation...I need ADD meds that don't leave me staring off into fucking space at work...GAHHH!  Very fucking frustrated!  Anyone with input re laptop or car, please comment...*sigh* is sick as a dog & about to go home early...bluhhhh Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile* Meow? Sick of this nihilistic depression shit--fine, life may be meaningless, I may be right about all the other disturbingly bleak shit I've been thinking...but I'm not a self-killer so I'm stuck here--might as well pull it together and live this crazy life I've got anyway, eh?  Some change is in the works (just in time for the New Year, ironically). Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning. Happy thingy, people... Is still pretty much on facebook hiatus...if you message me I'll probably answer though. Otherwise, most of you know where to find me! Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but ""I'M NOT DEAD YET!!"" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed* My, how the randomness abounds!...but I need some sleep. Yay Mythbusters!  Ninjas, explosions, and science, oh my! :D *nerdnerdnerd* Eh, why the hell not:  THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. Lets see how honest my FB friends are. Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes ME. It can only be 1 word. No more than 1 word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. Wonder how many brave friends will do this. *sigh* Meh. Bleh. Feh!! Gah...sick of feeling like crap! Gods deliver me from resilient falltime ailments...*brandishes stick menacingly...then gets dizzy and passes out* Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.) Doing enough work to compensate for being in Atlanta Thursday & Friday...blehhhh.  (Still at work at frickin' midnight!)  But the trip, the company & the brief respite from LI will be soooo bloody appreciated. Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.  Getting the fuck outta LI, seeing my superawesome folks, finally getting some proper southern food, and maybe even checking out Decatur nightlife & Williams Street...the word of the day is ""YAAAYYYYY!"" Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored! is currently being a disgruntled employee...grrr. *brandishes fist ineffectually* is checking her facebook a little more than she used to...but facebook still bombards her with more information than she has time to fool with!  Taking things at a glance. My body may be a medical nightmare, but at least it leaves me hangover-free for some reason, hah!  Glad to see everyone last night...thanks all for the *loves* and for those who were kind in the face of my drunken overhonesty, oy. Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under ""O"" for ""Owwww""* Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!! is somewhat on hiatus from facebook for a while...may check it occasionally...*shrug* I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles* Gah, bus schedules are confusing! *scratches head, which then explodes* ""Some of the shows on MTV are not my cup of tea...mainly because I don't like huge pieces of shit in my tea!"" Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears. Waking from a really good dream into harsh reality is one of the great cruelties of life.  *groggy and disgruntled* I'm so pleased today I might start glowing! XD ...Hopefully more in a pleasant way than a radioactive way.  A new year is directly impending, YAY!!  Ecstatic for a symbolic fresh start// season of change, let me tell you! I will be fine.  I've gotten through everything that has ever been thrown at me--nothing can keep me down for long. Errghhh...insomnia suuuuucks! *whines, ears begin to bleed* ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche Checking out a car in the morning...hope it checks out--I'm not enjoying this carless whatnottery!"

Made pretty good pastries, will have them perfected when the next batch is made. is eating dinasour oatmeal!! got his hair cut at 2 today.

He also made really good chocolate chip cookies, from scratch by hand. just got a shot in his ass for his headache, that works like how he imagines works like Vicodin for House's leg.

I think I'm actually going to like law school, but I wish my love could be here with me!

Basically I'm doing something I don't usually do and that is sulking and feeling really sorry for myself.  BUT, home on Thursday after the exam//dentist appt.!!! :) So I really have a final tomorrow... I think that's finally starting to set in. well my first class was cancelled because the professor thinks her whole family has come down with H1N1, so I'm trying to be productive anyway.... civ pro, property, and torts... my three fun new friends.... :) Got a paid (as opposed to the increasingly popular unpaid) J-O-B in a law firm!  Starting next Friday, I'll work Fridays until school is out, then full time for the summer!  That and having a snow day all rolled into one makes today a great day...  :) Also, Happy XXrd Birthday to my Mama! Summer job interview tomorrow... :)  Hoping it'll be my first and last!! ohh, cleaning then reading for school... all the while just thinking about how much I can't wait to go home on Thursday!  Lots of time with my one and only, hunting, and all the fun and good people that go along with both!  Can Not Wait. Whoa... way too sleepy, way too early... Cookies and hot chocolate time.... :) working on my memo... yuck.. today is one of those ""I don't like law school..."" days.  My solution= pretending that I'm not in law school for the rest of the day... tv time. Only two more days at home, then off to Richmond on Tuesday.  Where did the time go!? work till seven, then something with the fiance... :) is wondering why her attention span is so pitiful... must... pay... attention... So *PROPNAME* just ate the end of my highlighter... I think that means she wants me to stop studying..."

Who's out there??? wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions. just went paintballing in SD... always a great time!  The bruises go away after a few days, but the memories of capping your friends last a lifetime. Thanks to the beauty of anythingyouwantdelivery.com ...
